# Data-Preprocessing-Guide

## 🎯 Objective
Welcome! This notebook is designed to serve as a comprehensive introduction to data preprocessing. We'll cover what data processing is, why it's essential in machine learning, and walk through many of the most commonly used data processing techniques.

My goal is to make this notebook a one-stop resource for beginners who want to build a solid foundation and become proficient in data processing.

## 📝 Notes
I’d like to preface this by saying that I’m still learning EDA myself.  
This notebook is both a **learning resource for others** and a **learning journey for me**.  

If you notice any mistakes, unclear explanations, or missing details, I’d greatly appreciate feedback or suggestions for improvement. Let’s learn together! 🚀
